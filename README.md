In this project, I looked at datasets from Amazon reviews. 
The dataset comes from https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/, and is a subset of a large datasets just showing reviews for musical instruments. 
Only UserID, ItemID, Rating and Timestamp has been left during data cleaning process as we will be focusing on Item ID and Rating for each product.

The project's aim was to understand recommendation algorithms, optimizing product suggestions for new and existing users based on their preferences and behavior. 
To achieve this, I created question that can be answered for business units, ensuring alignment and effective implementation. 
The focus was on unraveling recommendation algorithms to enhance user experience through personalized product recommendations.
