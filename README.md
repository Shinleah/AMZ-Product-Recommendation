In this project, I looked at datasets from Amazon reviews. 
The dataset comes from https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/, and is a subset of a large dataset just showing reviews for musical instruments. 
Only UserID, ItemID, Rating, and Timestamp have been left during the data cleaning process as the project will be focusing on Item ID and Rating for each product.

The project aimed to understand recommendation algorithms, and optimize product suggestions for new and existing users based on their preferences and behavior. 
To achieve this, I created questions that can be answered for business units, ensuring alignment and effective implementation. 
The focus was on unraveling recommendation algorithms to enhance user experience through personalized product recommendations.
